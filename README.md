This repository provides supporting documents for an introduction to Keras workshop at Franceisai on Sep. 16, 2016.

Keras is an open-source Deep Learning framework written in Python. [Learn more](https://keras.io/)

The slides of the presentation are available as HTML or PDF in this repository.

After a very brief introduction to neural networks, we build in a few dozens of line an image classifier using Keras. The step-by-step process is available in the notebook file (iPython notebook/html versions included).


*The workshop is based on Fran√ßois Chollet's blog post : [Building powerful image classification models using very little data](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html) which provides a great example of the ease-of-use and readibility of Keras.*
