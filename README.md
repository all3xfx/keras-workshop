This repository provides supporting documents for an introduction to Keras workshop at Franceisai on Sep. 16, 2016.

Keras is an open-source Deep Learning framework written in Python. [Learn more](https://keras.io/)

The slides of the presentation are available as HTML in this repository or at [https://gggdomi.github.io/keras-workshop/](https://gggdomi.github.io/keras-workshop/)

After a very brief introduction to neural networks, we build in a few dozens of line an image classifier using Keras. The step-by-step process is available in the ready-to-run notebook.ipynb file (or the [HTML version](https://gggdomi.github.io/keras-workshop/notebook.html)).


*The workshop is based on Fran√ßois Chollet's blog post : [Building powerful image classification models using very little data](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html) which provides a great example of the ease-of-use and readibility of Keras.*
